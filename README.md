This is my personal CTC based speech recognition playground project using tensorflow , the code is not organized ( I plan to do it , when everything is stable )

current capabilities :
Multidata Training and Inference

Personal Comments : I find tensorflow API unintuitive , and unfriendly , I will enventually switch to pytorch , this is just for playing
